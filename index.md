# Eche Mkpadi

Hello! I am Eche. This is the home for all my findings on how computers work at all levels. I mostly write applications running in virtual machines (JVM, v8, etc.) but during my unpaid hours I roam around the compiled land (Rust, C, etc.).

#### [A Networking Date](./posts/netcat.md)
For many, a good weekend means: rest, some adventure and family time. My adventure over the weekend was some naive chat system using Netcat (nc) and ssh. Netcat is a popular unix network tool. It is commonly used for port scanning.

The goal was to set up a naive communication tunnel between two computers.


#### [Kafka](./posts/kafka.md)
[Kafka](http://kafka.apache.org/) is an event streaming platform. This means that in SOA where events from one microservice has to be communicated to another microservice (or other microservices) we can use Kafka to send (stream) these events (messages), analyse them and even log them (store them permanently). Kafka streams these events which means that it captures data in real-time, a continuous flow of data.
