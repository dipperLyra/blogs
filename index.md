The technology used for common network communication (e.g. calls and text) is not end-to-end encrypted. Therefore, the operators can have records of your calls and activities. This on its own is not very worrisome but knowing the security implications can be.

### [Writing a quick paste manager for MacOs](./posts/pasteboard-mgr.md)

Most personal software on my computer are CLI tools but I needed a GUI tool to help me manage pasteboard history. The lack of a proper pasteboard manager on MacOs can be frustrating. Whatever latest thing copied replaces the pasteboard content and there is no way to get previously copied texts.

This means that in SOA where events from one microservice has to be communicated to another microservice (or other microservices) we can use Kafka to send (stream) these events (messages), analyse them and even log them (store them permanently). Kafka streams these events which means that it captures data in real-time, a continuous flow of data.
