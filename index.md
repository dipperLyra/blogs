# Eche Mkpadi

Hello! I am Eche. This is the home for all my findings on how computers work at all levels. I mostly write applications running in virtual machines (JVM, v8, etc.) but during my unpaid hours I roam around the compiled land (Rust, C, etc.).

### [Writing a quick paste manager for MacOs](./posts/pasteboard-mgr.md)

Most personal software on my computer are CLI tools but I needed a GUI tool to help me manage pasteboard history. The lack of a proper pasteboard manager on MacOs can be frustrating. Whatever latest thing copied replaces the pasteboard content and there is no way to get previously copied texts. Not long ago my friends and I were complaining about it but yesterday I decided I had been frustrated enough to suspend everything and do a dirty fix.

### [A Networking Date](./posts/netcat.md)

The goal was to set up a naive communication tunnel between two computers.

### [Kafka](./posts/kafka.md)

[Kafka](http://kafka.apache.org/) is an event streaming platform. This means that in SOA where events from one microservice has to be communicated to another microservice (or other microservices) we can use Kafka to send (stream) these events (messages), analyse them and even log them (store them permanently). Kafka streams these events which means that it captures data in real-time, a continuous flow of data.
