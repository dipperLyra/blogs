# Gratitude for Arrays and LinkedList

Beautiful in thy manifestations. Even though thou art many yet thou art simple.

Thee, Array, gave us the ability to fetch any data within thy bosom in constant time, we should only but speak the true name, the index, and we shall have it.

What would devour treasuries of memories and time with Arrays, arbitrary growth, LinkedList maketh easy.

Even in many implementations of the Hammer, Hashmap, the duo is found.
Hashmap's delightful constant time access cometh from thee, Array. When multiple keys hash to the same array bucket in a Hashmap, LinkedList maketh it easy to chain the keys to the same bucket.
